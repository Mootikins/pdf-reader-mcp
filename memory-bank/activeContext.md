# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.2.0 Implementation & Testing)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The focus was on implementing the refined v0.2.0 toolset and performing initial
functional testing.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- **v0.2.0 Toolset Implemented:** The 12 tools defined in the previous context
  (`list_files`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `write_content`, `delete_items`,
  `create_directories`, `chmod_items`, `chown_items`, `move_items`,
  `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`) have been implemented in
  `src/index.ts`.
  - Handlers for new tools (`stat_items`, `chown_items`, `copy_items`) were
    added.
  - Existing handlers were modified to support batch operations and renamed
    where necessary.
  - Tool definitions and the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler were updated.
  - Server version updated to `0.2.0`.
- **Initial Functional Testing:** Performed a series of tests using the MCP
  tools:
  - Created test directories and files (`create_directories`, `write_content`).
  - Verified file existence and content (`read_content`, `stat_items`).
  - Tested file modification (`write_content` with append, `replace_content`).
  - Tested file/directory movement and copying (`move_items`, `copy_items`).
  - Tested content searching (`search_files`).
  - Tested item deletion (`delete_items`).
- **`list_files` Debugging:** Encountered persistent issues with `list_files`
  when using `glob` (for recursion or stats).
  - Multiple attempts were made to fix `glob` options and logic.
  - Added an optimization to use `fs.readdir` for simple non-recursive, no-stats
    cases, which works correctly.
  - The `glob` path continues to fail or return empty results, likely due to
    server reload issues preventing the latest code fixes/logging from executing
    reliably for that specific code path.
- **MCP Settings Updated:** Corrected the `alwaysAllow` list in
  `mcp_settings.json` to include the v0.2.0 tool names and incremented
  `RELOAD_TRIGGER` multiple times to attempt server restarts.

## 3. Next Steps / Considerations

- **Resolve `list_files` / Server Reload Issue:** The primary remaining issue is
  diagnosing why the `glob`-based path in `list_files` isn't working and/or why
  the server process isn't reliably reloading code changes. This might require
  external investigation of the MCP host environment or server management.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Once the `list_files` issue is resolved, more
  comprehensive testing is needed, especially focusing on:
  - Edge cases for all tools (empty inputs, special characters, permissions).
  - `list_files` with recursion and stats enabled.
  - `chmod_items` and `chown_items` in a suitable environment.
  - Error handling for batch operations (partial success/failure reporting).
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove debugging logs added to `handleListFiles` and
  `handleWriteContent` once the issues are resolved.
- **Documentation Review:** Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status.

## 4. Active Decisions

- The v0.2.0 toolset implementation in `src/index.ts` is largely complete.
- The `fs.readdir` optimization for simple `list_files` cases is effective.
- Further debugging of the `glob` path in `list_files` is blocked by suspected
  server reload problems.
