# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (Toolset Refinement)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The focus has shifted from initial implementation to refining and consolidating
the server's toolset based on user feedback and discussion. This involved:

- Reviewing the initially implemented tools.
- Discussing potential omissions (like copy, stat, chown).
- Evaluating different consolidation strategies (e.g., single `manage_items` vs.
  more granular tools).
- Agreeing on a final set of tools designed for clarity and comprehensive batch
  processing capabilities.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- **Refined and Consolidated Toolset (v0.2.0):** A final set of 12 tools has
  been defined, aiming for clarity, comprehensive functionality, and batch
  processing support where applicable:
  - `list_files`: List directory contents.
  - `stat_items`: Get status for multiple specified paths. (New)
  - `read_content`: Read content from multiple files (via `paths` array).
  - `write_content`: Write/append content to multiple files (via `items` array).
  - `delete_items`: Delete multiple files/directories (via `paths` array).
  - `create_directories`: Create multiple directories (via `paths` array).
  - `chmod_items`: Change mode for multiple items (via `paths` array).
  - `chown_items`: Change owner/group for multiple items (via `paths` array).
    (New)
  - `move_items`: Move/rename multiple items (via `operations` array).
  - `copy_items`: Copy multiple items (via `operations` array). (New)
  - `search_files`: Search content within files in a directory (read-only).
  - `replace_content`: Replace content within files across multiple specified
    paths (via `paths` array).
- **Batch Operations:** Explicitly designed tools (`stat_items`, `read_content`,
  `write_content`, `delete_items`, `create_directories`, `chmod_items`,
  `chown_items`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `replace_content`) to handle
  multiple items/operations through array inputs for efficiency.
- **Search vs. Replace Separation:** Maintained `search_files` (read-only) and
  `replace_content` (write) as separate tools for clarity and safety.
- **Server Version:** Conceptually updated to `v0.2.0` to reflect the
  significant toolset changes (actual implementation pending).
- **Path Resolution Strategy:** (Remains unchanged) Uses `PROJECT_ROOT` and
  absolute paths internally via `glob`, converting back to relative paths for
  output.
- **Type Handling for `glob`:** (Remains unchanged) Corrected logic in
  `handleListFiles`.

## 3. Next Steps / Considerations

- **Implementation:** Implement the changes to the toolset:
  - Add handlers for `stat_items`, `chown_items`, `copy_items`.
  - Modify existing handlers (`read_file` -> `read_content`, `write_file` ->
    `write_content`, `delete_items`, `create_directories`, `chmod` ->
    `chmod_items`, `move_item` -> `move_items`, `search_and_replace*` ->
    `replace_content`) to support batch operations via array inputs as defined.
  - Update tool definitions and registration in `index.ts`.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the _new consolidated toolset_ is
  crucial, focusing on:
  - Correct handling of batch operations (all items processed, correct
    results/errors reported per item).
  - Edge cases for each tool (empty arrays, non-existent paths, permissions,
    special characters).
  - Functionality of the new tools (`stat_items`, `chown_items`, `copy_items`).
- **Error Handling Refinement:** Review and potentially refine error handling
  for batch operations (how to report partial success/failure) and for new tools
  (`chown` errors, copy errors). Consider `EXDEV` for `move_items`/`copy_items`.
- **Configuration:** (Remains unchanged) Consider if explicit `PROJECT_ROOT`
  configuration is needed.
- **`.clinerules`:** (Remains unchanged) No project-specific rules identified
  yet.

## 4. Active Decisions

- The final toolset consists of the 12 tools listed above, designed for clarity
  and batch processing.
- `search_files` and `replace_content` remain separate.
- The stdio transport mechanism is sufficient.
- The security model based on `resolvePath` is adequate.
