# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.4.11 - Final Docs & CI/CD)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The focus was on finalizing deployment automation and documentation, ensuring
accuracy and standard compliance.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- **README Refinement & Correction:** Iteratively updated `README.md` based on
  feedback:
  - Added npm and Docker Hub badges.
  - Restructured to prioritize `npx` usage as the recommended quick start.
  - Added a dedicated section highlighting key features/selling points (security
    via relative paths, efficiency via batch operations).
  - Included detailed instructions for Docker usage, emphasizing volume
    mounting.
  - Added/removed/re-added/ **finally removed** comments in JSON examples to
    ensure **standard JSON compliance** after clarification.
  - Included sections on development and contributing.
- **Dockerization:**
  - Created `.dockerignore` and `Dockerfile` (multi-stage build).
  - Iteratively debugged `Dockerfile` build issues related to `.dockerignore`
    exclusions and `npm ci` script execution order, resolving them by using
    `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and running `npm run build` after copying all
    source.
- **CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions):**
  - Modified `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to automate publishing to both npm
    and Docker Hub on pushes to `main`.
- **Versioning:** Incremented the package version multiple times (up to
  `0.4.11`) in `package.json` to trigger CI/CD runs for README updates, Docker
  fixes, and the final JSON comment correction.

## 3. Next Steps / Considerations

- **Verify CI/CD:** Confirm the latest GitHub Actions run (triggered by commit
  `3efa65b` for version `0.4.11`) successfully published to both npm and Docker
  Hub with the _correct_ README (JSON comments removed).
- **Resolve `list_files` / Server Reload Issue:** (Previous issue) The primary
  remaining _functional_ issue is diagnosing why the `glob`-based path in
  `list_files` wasn't working reliably.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Perform thorough testing (edge cases, `list_files`
  advanced modes, permissions, batch errors).
- **Update Other Memory Bank Files:** Review `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`,
  and `techContext.md` for consistency.

## 4. Active Decisions

- `npx` is the primary recommended usage method in the documentation.
- Docker support is implemented and automated via GitHub Actions.
- The `Dockerfile` build process is corrected.
- The `README.md` structure and content are finalized, with JSON examples
  adhering to standard JSON (no comments).
