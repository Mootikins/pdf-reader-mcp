# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (Initial Creation)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate focus has been the initial creation and implementation of the
Filesystem MCP server based on the user's request. This involved:

- Setting up the Node.js/TypeScript project structure.
- Defining and implementing the core set of filesystem tools requested in the
  `projectbrief.md`.
- Iteratively debugging and refining the `list_files` tool, particularly
  addressing issues with path resolution and type handling when using the `glob`
  library with recursion and stats options.
- Adding the `move_item` tool based on user feedback after the initial
  completion attempt.
- Ensuring the server builds correctly and responds to basic MCP requests.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- **Path Resolution Strategy:** Adopted a strategy where `glob` is always run
  from `PROJECT_ROOT` and returns absolute paths. `path.relative` is then used
  to calculate the correct relative path for output, and `fs.stat` uses the
  absolute path from `glob`. This resolved issues with inconsistent relative
  paths during recursion, especially on Windows.
- **Type Handling for `glob`:** Corrected the type checking logic in
  `handleListFiles` to properly identify the structure of objects returned by
  `glob` when `stat: true` or `withFileTypes: true` are used, avoiding
  `instanceof` checks on TypeScript types.
- **Added `move_item`:** Incorporated the `move_item` tool using `fs.rename` to
  handle both renaming files/directories and moving them into existing
  directories. Basic error handling for `ENOENT` and permissions errors was
  included.
- **Server Version:** Incremented server version to `0.1.1` after adding the
  `move_item` tool.

## 3. Next Steps / Considerations

- **Testing:** While basic functionality and the problematic `list_files` case
  have been tested, more comprehensive testing of all tools with various edge
  cases (empty files, special characters in paths, large directories, permission
  issues, moving across different drives if applicable) would be beneficial.
- **Error Handling Refinement:** Could potentially add more specific error
  handling, e.g., for `EXDEV` errors during `move_item` (cross-device move
  requires copy+delete).
- **Configuration:** Currently, `PROJECT_ROOT` is determined based on the
  script's location. Consider if a more explicit configuration method (e.g.,
  environment variable, command-line argument) is needed for different
  deployment scenarios.
- **`.clinerules`:** No project-specific rules have been identified or added to
  `.clinerules` yet.

## 4. Active Decisions

- The current set of tools fulfills the initial requirements plus the added
  `move_item` request.
- The stdio transport mechanism is sufficient for the intended use case (child
  process).
- The security model based on `resolvePath` is deemed adequate for preventing
  path traversal within the defined constraints.
