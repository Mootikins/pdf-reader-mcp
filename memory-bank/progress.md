# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Strict Dev Standards Applied)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed.
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source,
  per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented and integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup working.
- **Documentation:**
    - `README.md`: Basic structure, **Sponsor badges added**.
    - Memory Bank: Core files updated.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml` updated for CI/CD, including **validate step (format, lint, test w/ coverage)**.
- **Testing Framework (Vitest):**
    - Integrated, configured (`vitest.config.ts` with **100% coverage threshold**).
    - Basic tests passing.
- **Linter (ESLint):**
  - Integrated, configured (`eslint.config.js`) including Prettier compatibility and **strict type-aware rules** (`strictTypeChecked`).
  - Scripts (`lint`, `lint:fix`, `validate`) added to `package.json`.
  - Codebase passes all current ESLint checks.
- **Formatter (Prettier):**
  - Integrated, configured (`.prettierrc.cjs`), integrated with ESLint.
  - Scripts (`format`, `check-format`, `validate`) added to `package.json`.
  - Codebase formatted.
- **TypeScript Configuration:** `tsconfig.json` updated with **strictest settings**.
- **Sponsorship:** `.github/FUNDING.yml` created.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Test Coverage**: Need to run `npm run test:cov` to **verify 100% coverage** is actually met. May need to add more tests or adjust coverage exclusions.
- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build`.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Verify error handling.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements based on strict rules.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Test the full workflow with a version tag.
- **Documentation (Major):**
    - Rewrite `README.md` with "Hard Sell" approach, performance data, etc.
    - Set up VitePress (`docs` folder).
    - Create Hero Page and detailed documentation content.
    - Integrate Sponsor calls-to-action throughout docs.
- **Benchmarking:** Implement and run benchmark tests for core functions.
- **(Optional) Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider adding Husky + lint-staged.

## 3. Current Status

Core development standards (Strict TypeScript, Strict ESLint, Prettier, Vitest with 100% coverage goal, CI validation) are configured. Codebase passes current checks. Sponsorship file created and README badges added. Next immediate step is to verify 100% test coverage. Major documentation and benchmarking tasks remain.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **100% Coverage Goal:** Achieving and maintaining 100% coverage can be challenging and time-consuming. Need to ensure tests are meaningful and not just chasing numbers. Exclusions in `vitest.config.ts` might need tuning.
- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** API complexity, text extraction accuracy depends on PDF, potential Node.js compatibility nuances.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling implemented; specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement.
- **Performance:** Not tested on very large PDFs. Benchmarking needed.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic handles per-source `pages`; testing combinations is important.
