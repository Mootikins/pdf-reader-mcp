# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Initial Implementation)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed
  (`pdf-parse` added).
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented with parameters, supports an array of local
    paths/URLs (`sources`), integrated. Returns an array of results.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup allows the server to start and
  list the single `read_pdf` tool. All unused handlers removed.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Updated with PDF tool descriptions.
  - Memory Bank: Core files created/updated with initial context.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build` again after adding multi-source
  support.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool with various parameter combinations
    and multiple sources (paths and URLs mixed) via
    `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent. Verify the `results`
    array structure and error handling per source.
  - Specifically test `read_pdf` with the `pages` parameter for different page
    ranges and edge cases across multiple sources.
  - Verify error handling (e.g., file not found, URL fetch errors, corrupted
    PDF).
- **Testing Framework:** Consider adding automated tests (e.g., using Jest or
  Vitest) for handlers.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements or edge cases missed.
- **Publishing Setup:** Ensure GitHub Actions workflow in
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` is correctly configured for the new package
  name and Docker image name (if not already done).

## 3. Current Status

Added multi-source support to `read_pdf` handler. Documentation updated. Ready
for final build and testing.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** While more maintained, its API is more complex
  than `pdf-parse`. Text extraction accuracy still depends on the PDF structure.
  Potential compatibility nuances in Node.js environment exist.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for file access and URL fetching
  implemented. More specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement based on
  testing.
- **Performance:** Performance on very large PDF files hasn't been tested.
- **Multi-Source Handling:** The handler now loops through sources. Error
  handling for individual sources within the loop needs careful testing. Output
  structure is now an array of results.
