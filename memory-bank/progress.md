# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.5.1 - Batch Error Handling & Docs)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside
  the determined `PROJECT_ROOT` and rejects absolute paths.
- **Project Root Determination:** Logic updated to use the server's current
  working directory (`process.cwd()`) as the `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling operation
  relative to the agent's context _if launched correctly_.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT`.
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`,
  `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`,
  `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case)
  have passed basic functional tests.
- **Reliable Batch Error Handling:** All tools supporting multiple
  items/operations (e.g., `delete_items`, `edit_file`, `write_content`) now
  consistently attempt all items and return detailed individual results
  (success/failure/skipped + error message).
- **`edit_file` Tool (Basic Implementation):** Added new tool with support for
  insertion, text search/replace/delete, indentation preservation, and diff
  output. Zod schema defined and integrated. Tested with multiple files and
  mixed outcomes (success/skipped/fail). Return structure fixed for MCP
  compliance.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage
  instructions (prioritizing `npx`, adding `bunx` alternative), **detailed
  feature descriptions**, Docker instructions, and contribution guidelines. JSON
  examples now correctly **omit comments** for standard JSON compliance.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly.
  - Build process debugged and corrected (using `npm ci --ignore-scripts`).
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) successfully automates:
    - Publishing to npm on `main` branch pushes.
    - Building and pushing Docker image to Docker Hub (`shtse8/filesystem-mcp`)
      on `main` branch pushes.
- **Versioning:** Package version consistently incremented to trigger releases
  (updated to `0.5.1`).

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Test Dynamic Root Logic:** Verify the server operates correctly when
  launched with different `cwd` settings representing different projects.
- **Launcher Integration Testing:** Confirm the system launching the server sets
  the `cwd` appropriately.
- **Update `README.md`:** (Done - Added detailed features, already documented
  `cwd` requirement).
- **Versioning:** (Done - Updated `package.json` to `0.5.1`). Potentially create
  a git tag.
- **CI/CD Verification:** Ensure the pipeline works with the changes.
- **Resolve `list_files` Issue (Glob Path):** (Lower priority) Investigate the
  `glob`-based execution path within `handleListFiles`.
- **Comprehensive Testing (Post-Root Change):** Re-test core functionality, edge
  cases, permissions (`chmod`/`chown`), cross-device moves/copies in the context
  of the dynamic root.
- **Refine Batch Error Handling:** (Done - Verified consistent "continue on
  error" behavior and detailed reporting).
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining debugging logs.
- **`edit_file` Regex Support:** Implement regex matching for search patterns.

## 3. Current Status

- **Project Root Logic Updated:** Server now uses `process.cwd()` for the
  project root.
- **Core Functionality Implemented:** All defined tools are implemented and
  passed basic tests. Batch error handling confirmed.
- **Deployment Automated:** Publishing to npm and Docker Hub is handled by
  GitHub Actions.
- **Documentation Updated (Internal & Public):** Memory Bank files
  (`systemPatterns`, `productContext`, `techContext`, `activeContext`,
  `progress`) updated. `README.md` updated with detailed features and batch
  handling notes.
- **Primary Blocker:** Need to test the dynamic root behavior thoroughly and
  ensure the launcher integration works as expected.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality is now critically dependent on
  the launching process setting the correct `cwd` for the target project.
  Incorrect `cwd` will lead to operations on the wrong directory.
- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Potential issue with recursion/stats enabled
  needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
