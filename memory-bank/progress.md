# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.1.1)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests, providing
  schemas for all implemented tools.
- **Core Tools Implemented:**
  - `list_files`: Successfully lists files/directories, handles recursion
    (`recursive: true`), includes stats (`include_stats: true`), and correctly
    resolves/formats paths relative to the requested directory, even during
    recursion. Handles listing single files with stats.
  - `read_file`: Reads and returns the content of a specified file.
  - `write_file`: Writes content to a specified file, creating parent
    directories if necessary and overwriting existing files.
  - `read_multiple_files`: Reads content from an array of file paths.
  - `write_multiple_files`: Writes content to an array of file paths.
  - `delete_items`: Deletes specified files or directories recursively.
  - `create_directories`: Creates specified directories, including intermediate
    ones.
  - `search_and_replace`: Performs search and replace within a single file,
    supporting plain text and regex.
  - `search_files`: Searches for regex patterns across files matching a glob
    pattern within a directory.
  - `search_and_replace_multiple_files`: Performs search and replace across
    multiple files matching a glob pattern.
  - `chmod`: Changes file/directory permissions (effectiveness depends on OS).
  - `move_item`: Moves/renames files or directories, including moving into an
    existing directory.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside
  the project root and rejects absolute paths.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like "file not found"
  (`ENOENT`) and permission errors (`EPERM`, `EACCES`) by returning appropriate
  MCP errors.

## 2. What's Left to Build (According to Brief)

- All core requirements outlined in the `projectbrief.md` (v0.1.1) have been
  implemented.

## 3. Current Status

- **Complete:** The initial development and implementation phase, including the
  addition of the `move_item` tool based on feedback, is complete.
- **Ready for Use:** The server is functional and can be used by the agent host
  environment.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Limited Testing:** Only basic functionality and specific bug fixes for
  `list_files` have been tested. Comprehensive testing across different
  scenarios and edge cases is recommended.
- **Cross-Device Moves:** The `move_item` tool currently uses `fs.rename`, which
  may fail if the source and destination are on different devices/partitions
  (raising an `EXDEV` error). A fallback mechanism (copy then delete) could be
  implemented for true cross-device support if needed.
- **Windows `chmod`:** The `chmod` tool's effectiveness on Windows is limited
  due to the OS's different permission model.
- **Large File Streaming:** Reading/writing very large files might consume
  significant memory as the current implementation reads/writes the entire
  content at once. Streaming support was out of scope but could be a future
  enhancement.
