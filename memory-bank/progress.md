# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Initial Implementation)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed
  (`pdf-parse` added).
- **Core Tool Handlers:**
  - `read_pdf_all_text`: Implemented, integrated.
  - `read_pdf_page_text`: Implemented (using `pagerender`), integrated.
  - `get_pdf_metadata`: Implemented, integrated.
  - `get_pdf_page_count`: Implemented, integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup inherited from `filesystem-mcp`
  should allow the server to start and list the new tools.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Updated with PDF tool descriptions.
  - Memory Bank: Core files created/updated with initial context.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test each PDF tool with actual PDF files (various types if possible) using
    `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Specifically test `read_pdf_page_text` with different page ranges and edge
    cases.
  - Verify error handling (e.g., file not found, corrupted PDF).
- **Testing Framework:** Consider adding automated tests (e.g., using Jest or
  Vitest) for handlers.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements or edge cases missed.
- **Publishing Setup:** Ensure GitHub Actions workflow in
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` is correctly configured for the new package
  name and Docker image name (if not already done).

## 3. Current Status

Initial implementation of the core PDF reading tools is complete. Documentation
updated. Ready for build and testing.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdf-parse` Limitations:** The accuracy of text extraction, especially for
  complex layouts or scanned PDFs, depends heavily on `pdf-parse`. Page number
  detection in `pagerender` might need verification (1-based vs 0-based).
- **Error Handling:** Current error handling is basic; more specific error types
  or details might be needed based on testing.
- **Performance:** Performance on very large PDF files hasn't been tested.
- **Inherited Filesystem Tools:** The server still contains the original
  filesystem tool handlers (`listFiles`, `editFile`, etc.). Decide if these
  should be kept or removed. If kept, ensure they don't conflict and
  documentation reflects their presence. (Current README focuses only on PDF
  tools).
