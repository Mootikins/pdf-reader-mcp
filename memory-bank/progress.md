# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Type-Aware Linting Enabled)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed.
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source,
  per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented and integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup working.
- **Documentation:** `README.md`, Memory Bank core files updated.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml` updated for CI/CD, including ESLint check.
- **Testing Framework (Vitest):** Integrated, configured, basic tests passing.
- **Linter (ESLint):**
  - Integrated, configured (`eslint.config.js`) including Prettier compatibility and **type-aware rules** (`recommendedTypeChecked`).
  - Scripts (`lint`, `lint:fix`) added to `package.json`.
  - Codebase passes all current ESLint checks.
- **Formatter (Prettier):**
  - Integrated, configured (`.prettierrc.cjs`), integrated with ESLint.
  - Scripts (`format`, `check-format`) added to `package.json`.
  - Codebase formatted.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build`.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Verify error handling.
- **Testing:** Core handlers have tests. Consider edge cases.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Test the full workflow with a version tag.
- **(Optional) Stricter ESLint Rules:** Consider `strictTypeChecked` rules if needed.
- **(Optional) Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider adding Husky + lint-staged.

## 3. Current Status

ESLint (with type-aware rules) and Prettier integrated and configured for code linting and formatting. Existing code passes linting checks and is formatted. Vitest testing framework integrated with basic tests passing. GitHub Actions workflow includes lint check. Ready for build and workflow verification.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** API complexity, text extraction accuracy depends on PDF, potential Node.js compatibility nuances.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling implemented; specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement.
- **Performance:** Not tested on very large PDFs.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic handles per-source `pages`; testing combinations is important.
- **Test Coverage:** Core functionality covered; can be expanded.
