# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.4.10 - Docker & CI/CD Ready)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal and
  rejects absolute paths.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT`.
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`,
  `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`,
  `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case)
  have passed basic functional tests. Batch operations are supported where
  applicable.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage
  instructions (prioritizing `npx`), feature highlights, Docker instructions,
  and contribution guidelines. JSON examples now include comments for
  readability within Markdown.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly.
  - Build process debugged and corrected.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) successfully automates:
    - Publishing to npm on `main` branch pushes.
    - Building and pushing Docker image to Docker Hub (`shtse8/filesystem-mcp`)
      on `main` branch pushes.
- **Versioning:** Package version consistently incremented to trigger releases
  (currently `0.4.10`).

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Resolve `list_files` Issue (Glob Path):** Fix or thoroughly investigate the
  `glob`-based execution path within `handleListFiles` used when
  `recursive: true` or `include_stats: true`. The previous suspicion of server
  reload issues might be less relevant now with stable CI/CD; needs focused
  testing.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Test `list_files` with recursion and stats once the underlying issue is
    resolved/understood.
  - Test `chmod_items` and `chown_items` in a suitable environment (verify
    permissions changes, document OS differences).
  - Test edge cases for all tools (empty arrays, special characters, permissions
    errors, large numbers of items, large files).
  - Test cross-device operations for `move_items` and `copy_items` (potential
    `EXDEV` errors).
- **Refine Batch Error Handling:** Review and potentially improve reporting for
  partial success/failure in batch operations.
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining debugging logs.
- **Update Other Memory Bank Files:** Review `systemPatterns.md` and
  `techContext.md` for consistency with Docker/CI additions.

## 3. Current Status

- **Core Functionality Implemented:** All defined tools are implemented.
- **Deployment Automated:** Publishing to npm and Docker Hub is handled by
  GitHub Actions.
- **Documentation Updated:** `README.md` is comprehensive and reflects current
  usage recommendations.
- **Primary Blocker:** The advanced functionality of `list_files`
  (recursion/stats via `glob`) remains the main known functional issue requiring
  investigation.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** May fail or return incorrect results when
  recursion or stats are enabled. Needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS; behavior
  needs clear documentation.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`); needs testing and potential
  fallback logic.
