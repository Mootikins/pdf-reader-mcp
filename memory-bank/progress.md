# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.2.0 Implemented & Tested)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself correctly (v0.2.0).
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests, providing
  schemas for the new v0.2.0 toolset.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal and
  rejects absolute paths (verified implicitly through tool usage).
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT` (verified via
  `stat_items`).
- **v0.2.0 Tools Implemented & Tested:**
  - `create_directories`: Functional for multiple paths.
  - `write_content`: Functional for multiple items, including `append` mode.
  - `stat_items`: Functional for multiple paths, including error reporting for
    non-existent paths.
  - `read_content`: Functional for multiple paths.
  - `move_items`: Functional for multiple operations (file move, file rename).
  - `copy_items`: Functional for file and directory copies.
  - `search_files`: Functional (read-only regex search).
  - `replace_content`: Functional for replacing content in multiple specified
    files.
  - `delete_items`: Functional for multiple files/directories.
  - `list_files` (Simple Case): Works correctly when `recursive: false` and
    `include_stats: false` (uses `fs.readdir`).
- **MCP Settings:** Updated `alwaysAllow` list and `RELOAD_TRIGGER` in
  `mcp_settings.json`.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Resolve `list_files` Issue:** Fix the `glob`-based execution path within
  `handleListFiles` used when `recursive: true` or `include_stats: true`. This
  seems blocked by server reload issues.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Test `list_files` with recursion and stats once the underlying issue is
    resolved.
  - Test `chmod_items` and `chown_items` in a suitable environment (verify
    permissions changes).
  - Test edge cases for all tools (empty arrays, special characters, permissions
    errors, large numbers of items).
  - Test cross-device operations for `move_items` and `copy_items`.
- **Refine Batch Error Handling:** Improve reporting for partial success/failure
  in batch operations if needed.
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove debugging logs from `handleListFiles` and
  `handleWriteContent`.

## 3. Current Status

- **Implementation Complete:** The v0.2.0 toolset is implemented in
  `src/index.ts`.
- **Initial Testing Done:** Most tools have passed basic functional tests.
- **Blocking Issue:** The `list_files` tool's advanced functionality (using
  `glob`) is not working reliably, likely due to server reload problems
  preventing code updates from taking effect for that specific path.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Fails or returns empty results when recursion
  or stats are enabled. Suspected server reload issue.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness will be limited by the OS. Needs
  documentation.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** Current implementation might fail (`EXDEV`);
  needs testing and potential fallback logic.
- **Large File Streaming:** (Remains an area for future enhancement if needed).
