# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.2.0 Defined)

## 1. What Works (Based on v0.1.1 Implementation)

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests, providing
  schemas for the _previously implemented_ tools (v0.1.1 set).
- **Core Tools Implemented (v0.1.1):**
  - `list_files`: Functional, including recursion and stats.
  - `read_file`, `write_file`: Basic single-file operations work.
  - `read_multiple_files`, `write_multiple_files`: Basic multi-file operations
    work.
  - `delete_items`, `create_directories`: Functional.
  - `search_and_replace`, `search_files`, `search_and_replace_multiple_files`:
    Functional.
  - `chmod`, `move_item`: Functional (with OS limitations noted).
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal and
  rejects absolute paths.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT`, `EPERM`,
  `EACCES`.

## 2. What's Left to Build (To Reach v0.2.0 Implementation)

- **Implement New Tools:**
  - `stat_items`: Create handler and logic.
  - `chown_items`: Create handler and logic (consider UID/GID input).
  - `copy_items`: Create handler and logic (handle recursion, overwrite).
- **Modify Existing Tools for Batch Operations & Consolidation:**
  - Refactor `read_file`/`read_multiple_files` into `read_content` (handler
    logic, schema).
  - Refactor `write_file`/`write_multiple_files` into `write_content` (handler
    logic, schema, add append mode).
  - Ensure `delete_items` handler correctly processes `paths` array.
  - Ensure `create_directories` handler correctly processes `paths` array.
  - Refactor `chmod` into `chmod_items` (handler logic, schema).
  - Refactor `move_item` into `move_items` (handler logic, schema, handle
    `operations` array).
  - Refactor `search_files`, `search_and_replace`,
    `search_and_replace_multiple_files` into `search_files` (read-only) and
    `replace_content` (write, batch paths). Update handlers and schemas.
- **Update Tool Registration:** Modify the `list_tools` handler and `call_tool`
  handler's `switch` statement in `index.ts` to reflect the new 12 tools.
- **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing on the _new_ v0.2.0 toolset,
  focusing on batch operations, new tools, and edge cases.

## 3. Current Status

- **Definition Complete:** The refined v0.2.0 toolset (12 tools with batch
  capabilities) has been defined and documented in the Memory Bank.
- **Implementation Pending:** The actual code changes required to implement the
  v0.2.0 toolset have **not** yet been made. The currently running code (if any)
  still reflects the v0.1.1 toolset.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement (Relevant to v0.2.0)

- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the _new_ batch operations and tools
  (`stat_items`, `chown_items`, `copy_items`) is required once implemented.
- **Batch Error Handling:** Define and implement a clear strategy for reporting
  results and errors when processing batch operations (e.g., partial success).
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** The `move_items` and `copy_items` tools will
  likely need specific handling (e.g., copy-then-delete fallback) for operations
  across different devices/partitions (`EXDEV` error).
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness will be limited by the OS. Need to
  document limitations clearly.
- **Large File Streaming:** (Remains an area for future enhancement if needed).
