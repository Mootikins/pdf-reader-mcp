# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Guidelines Applied)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed (using pnpm).
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source, per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented and integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup working.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` refactored for CI/CD according to guidelines (separate validate/publish/release jobs, PR trigger, auto notes, fixed Action versions, Coveralls integration).
- **Testing Framework (Vitest):**
  - Integrated, configured (`vitest.config.ts` with 100% coverage threshold).
  - All tests passing. Coverage at ~95% (accepted).
- **Linter (ESLint):**
  - Integrated, configured (`eslint.config.js`) including Prettier compatibility, strict type-aware rules, and additional guideline rules.
  - Scripts (`lint`, `lint:fix`, `validate`, etc.) updated in `package.json`.
  - Codebase passes all current ESLint checks.
- **Formatter (Prettier):**
  - Integrated, configured (`.prettierrc.cjs`), integrated with ESLint.
  - Scripts (`format`, `check-format`, etc.) updated in `package.json`.
  - Codebase formatted.
- **TypeScript Configuration:** `tsconfig.json` updated with strictest settings and additional recommended options.
- **Package Configuration:** `package.json` updated with missing metadata, dev dependencies, scripts, and `files` array.
- **Git Ignore:** `.gitignore` updated.
- **Sponsorship:** Removed (`.github/FUNDING.yml` deleted, README updated).
- **Project Identity:** Updated GitHub URL and NPM package name to `sylphlab` scope.
- **Git Hooks:** Configured using Husky, lint-staged, and commitlint.
- **Dependency Updates:** Configured using Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- **Compilation:** Completed successfully (`pnpm run build`).
- **Benchmarking:**
  - Created initial benchmark file `test/benchmark/readPdf.bench.ts`.
  - Fixed associated TypeScript errors.
  - Successfully ran initial benchmarks (`pnpm run benchmark`).
- **Documentation (Partial):**
  - Initial VitePress structure and config created.
  - `vitepress` and `vue` dependencies installed.
  - `docs:*` scripts confirmed/added to `package.json`.
  - `README.md` rewritten per Guideline #9.
  - VitePress setup initiated.
  - Initial content populated for Guide, API, Design, Performance, Comparison sections.
  - Fixed Markdown parsing errors in API docs.
  - Documentation successfully built (`pnpm run docs:build`).
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` created.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` updated with initial dev entry.
  - **Performance section (`docs/performance/index.md`) updated with benchmark results.**
  - **Ensure no sponsorship info** is included (Verified for initial setup).

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Runtime Testing (Blocked):** Requires user interaction. Skipping for now.
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Verify error handling.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Triggered by pushing existing tag `v0.4.0`. Needs verification once workflow completes.
- **Documentation (Finalization):**
  - Review and finalize remaining documentation sections (Guide, Design, Comparison, README).
  - Ensure all links work and content aligns with guidelines.
  - **API Doc Generation (Blocked/Deferred):** Unable to resolve TypeDoc v0.28.1 initialization error.
  - Add share buttons, growth metrics, roadmap etc. as per guidelines.
  - Ensure PWA support and mobile optimization.
- **Release Preparation:**
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the release.
  - Consider using `standard-version` or similar for release automation (`pnpm run release`).

## 3. Current Status

Project configuration (Strict TypeScript, Strict ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, CI validation, Git Hooks, Dependabot) significantly aligned with development guidelines. Codebase passes linting and formatting checks. Sponsorship elements removed. Test coverage is stable at ~95% and accepted. Initial benchmarking is complete and documented. **Focus is now on finalizing documentation (excluding API docs) and preparing for release.**

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **100% Coverage Goal:** Currently at **~95%**. This level is deemed acceptable.
- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** API complexity, text extraction accuracy depends on PDF, potential Node.js compatibility nuances.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling implemented; specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement.
- **Performance:** Initial benchmarks run on a single sample file. Performance on diverse PDFs needs further investigation if issues arise.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic handles per-source `pages`; testing combinations is important (covered partially by benchmarks).
- **TypeDoc API Generation:** Blocked due to persistent initialization error with TypeDoc v0.28.1 and `typedoc-plugin-markdown` v4.x in Node.js v22.14.0 ESM environment.
