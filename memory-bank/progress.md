# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Initial Implementation)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed
  (`pdf-parse` added).
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented with parameters (`include_full_text`,
    `include_metadata`, `include_page_count`, `pages`), supports local path and
    URL, integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup inherited from `filesystem-mcp`
  allows the server to start and list only the PDF tools. Unused filesystem
  handlers removed.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Updated with PDF tool descriptions.
  - Memory Bank: Core files created/updated with initial context.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build` again after tool consolidation.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool with various parameter combinations,
    using both local paths and URLs via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a
    live agent.
  - Specifically test `read_pdf_page_text` with different page ranges and edge
    cases.
  - Verify error handling (e.g., file not found, URL fetch errors, corrupted
    PDF).
- **Testing Framework:** Consider adding automated tests (e.g., using Jest or
  Vitest) for handlers.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements or edge cases missed.
- **Publishing Setup:** Ensure GitHub Actions workflow in
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` is correctly configured for the new package
  name and Docker image name (if not already done).

## 3. Current Status

Consolidation of PDF tools into `read_pdf` is complete. Documentation updated.
Ready for final build and testing.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdf-parse` Limitations:** The accuracy of text extraction, especially for
  complex layouts or scanned PDFs, depends heavily on `pdf-parse`. Page number
  detection in `pagerender` might need verification (1-based vs 0-based).
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for file access and URL fetching
  implemented. More specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement based on
  testing.
- **Performance:** Performance on very large PDF files hasn't been tested.
- **Tool Consolidation:** While simpler for the agent, the single `read_pdf`
  handler is now more complex internally. Thorough testing of parameter
  interactions is crucial.
