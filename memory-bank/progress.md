# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Initial Implementation)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed
  (`pdf-parse` added).
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source,
  per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented with parameters, supports an array of `sources`
    (each optionally specifying `pages`), integrated. Returns an array of
    results.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup allows the server to start and
  list the single `read_pdf` tool. All unused handlers removed.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Updated with PDF tool descriptions.
  - Memory Bank: Core files created/updated with initial context.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created with initial structure.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml` updated to trigger on main/tags, conditionally publish, and create releases using `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build`.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Verify error handling (e.g., file not found, URL fetch errors, corrupted PDF).
- **Testing Framework:** Consider adding automated tests (e.g., using Jest or Vitest) for handlers.
- **Refinement:** Review code for potential improvements or edge cases missed.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Test the updated GitHub Actions workflow by pushing a version tag (e.g., `v0.3.0`) and verifying npm/Docker publish and GitHub Release creation.

## 3. Current Status

Added `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`. Updated GitHub Actions workflow for improved release process. Ready for build and testing, including workflow verification.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** While more maintained, its API is more complex
  than `pdf-parse`. Text extraction accuracy still depends on the PDF structure.
  Potential compatibility nuances in Node.js environment exist.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for file access and URL fetching
  implemented. More specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement based on
  testing.
- **Performance:** Performance on very large PDF files hasn't been tested.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic now handles `pages` parameter within the source
  loop. Testing different combinations of sources with and without `pages` is
  important.
