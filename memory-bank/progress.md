# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (ESLint + Prettier Setup)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed.
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source,
  per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented and integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup working.
- **Documentation:** `README.md`, Memory Bank core files updated.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml` updated for CI/CD, including ESLint check.
- **Testing Framework (Vitest):** Integrated, configured, basic tests passing.
- **Linter (ESLint):** Integrated, configured (`eslint.config.js`), scripts added, codebase passes checks.
- **Formatter (Prettier):**
  - Installed `prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`.
  - Configured via `.prettierrc.cjs`.
  - Integrated with ESLint via `eslint-config-prettier` in `eslint.config.js`.
  - Added `format` and `check-format` scripts to `package.json`.
  - Codebase formatted using Prettier.

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Compilation:** Need to run `npm run build`.
- **Runtime Testing:**
  - Verify the server starts correctly.
  - Test the consolidated `read_pdf` tool via `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a live agent.
  - Verify error handling.
- **Testing:** Core handlers have tests. Consider edge cases.
- **Refinement:** Review code for improvements.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Test the full workflow with a version tag.
- **(Optional) Stricter ESLint Rules:** Consider enabling type-aware linting rules.
- **(Optional) Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider adding Husky + lint-staged.

## 3. Current Status

ESLint and Prettier integrated and configured for code linting and formatting. Existing code passes checks and is formatted. Vitest testing framework integrated with basic tests passing. GitHub Actions workflow includes lint check. Ready for build and workflow verification.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** API complexity, text extraction accuracy depends on PDF, potential Node.js compatibility nuances.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling implemented; specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement.
- **Performance:** Not tested on very large PDFs.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic handles per-source `pages`; testing combinations is important.
- **Test Coverage:** Core functionality covered; can be expanded.
